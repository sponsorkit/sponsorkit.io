## Contributing
You're always welcome to contribute to Sponsorkit and/or Bountyhunt by submitting pull requests or issues.

### Backend
You need Docker installed and running. In addition, you need .NET SDK 5, and a C# IDE. The project is self-bootstrapping from there, so it should be easy to get started.

### Frontend
There is a VS Code DevContainer definition available for the project. So if you have Docker installed and running, contributing should be simple from there.
